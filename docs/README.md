# Learn HTML5 Canvas API

A collection of my personal notes, examples, and other interesting resources related to the HTML5 Canvas API! 

## Motivation

After being inspired by [bisqwit's](https://github.com/bisqwit) DOS game [WSpeed](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/wspeed/), I figured it would be fun to try to build a clone that runs in the browser.

I'm approaching learning the API with a very elementary set of knowledge of the API. I want to understand the fundamentals before I reach for a useful library such as [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), or [phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser).
